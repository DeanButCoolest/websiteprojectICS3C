      <p>This is literally me and Jeff<br>
      </p>
    </h1>
  <p>I met Jeffrey back in grade 3, when he was obsessed with roblox. He still is, but that was one of my main takeaways from who he was.<br></p>
  <p>I never thought I would end up being friends with him, but I was a really dumb kid and so was he thus it was bound to happen.<br></p>
  <p>Today, he's obsessed with Nuclear reactors. So much so, that he dragged me into it and I now have an unhealthy obsession with anything nuclear powered (Not as much as jeff though).<br></p>
  <p>But I still have my own interests. I have a very unhealthy obsession over how different machines work, as well as military technology.<br></p>
  <p>Take the CL-1201 for example. I never knew about it until a few days ago, and today I know near everything about it.<br></p>
  <p>Essentially, the CL-1201 was a project by Lockheed that was supposed to be an airborne aircraft carrier. It weighed around 5265 tons, and had a wingspan of 340 meters. Crazy, right?<br></p>
