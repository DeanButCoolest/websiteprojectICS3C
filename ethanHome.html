    <h1>On this page, I'll tell you a bit about myself.</h1>

    <p>  I was never a normal child. I was hyper and imaginative, much more than the average child.</p>
<br>
    <p>  I was about 8 years old when I met Jeffery in grade 3, but we never became friends until a year later in grade 4.</p>
<br>
    <p>  We bonded almost immediately, as we had the same interests and we were both pretty weird. We are not sleeper agents.</p>
<br>
    <p>  I can't remember much else before grade 9, when we had a much stronger bond.</p>
<br>
    <p>  This year, My other friend connor, Jeff and I have been planning for college, mainly within the fact that we should share an apartment.</p>
<br>
    <p>The Main topics me and my friends talk about on a daily basis include events in the world and most importantly nuclear power.</p>
