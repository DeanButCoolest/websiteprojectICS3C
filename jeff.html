<h1>Jeff's page</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Jeff. Since this is my page, I'm going to talk a little bit about myself and by interests, so yea!</p>
<br>
<p>The best place to start is when I met Ethan, I met him sometime in grade 3 but we only really started being friends in grade 4. We became pretty good friends, we played together during recess, and we got along quite nicely.</p>
<br>
<p>My main 3 in the friend group consists of me, Ethan, and Connor. We get along really well and play games together, and every friday we go out for lunch and get pizza.</p>
<br>
<p>My interests are not very diverse, considering I am hyperfixated on about 2 things. The first one I will talk about is the one I am less interested in at the moment, but I know it's time will shine again soon, space. I LOVE space, it's so cool. I love planets and stars, the science behind them, black holes and everything. Everything to do with space is awesome, and will always be awesome, and despite it not being my main interest, I am always trying to be up-to-date on space news.</p>

<p>My next interest is my biggest one, and something that I am always actively studying, power generation. Specifically nuclear, although I also love to dive into fossil fuels. Nuclear energy and reactors are very interesting to me, and for good reason. I love the complexity and differences in reactor designs, I love researching disasters, nuclear energy is truly an amazing thing. I really like making fun of people who are anti-nuclear, as it us a very dumb belief. My favorite reactors have to be the CANDU design and the RBMK design, both fuel channel reactors. They are very neat.</p>

<p>Of course I can't just dedicate this to nuclear, recently I've had a surge of interest for coal and gas power plants. I find them fascinating, despite polluting the environment, they are so cool!</p>

<p>I am currently learning to code games, as game development is something that interests me. I would love to start making games, and I actually already have, such as my old scratch project called galaxy heist.
        You can play it here!</p>
